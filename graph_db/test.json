    "generatedResponse": "According to current medical research, the treatment of type 2 diabetes involves both medication and lifestyle changes. Metformin remains the primary first-line medication, working to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce glucose production. Recent studies have shown promising results with GLP-1 receptor agonists, which not only help control blood sugar but may also contribute to weight loss. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate medication adjustment are essential for optimal disease management."
